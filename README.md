# Image-Processing
This repository contains three projects for the Image Processing course I took at the department of computer science at Sharif University of Technology.

- **Image morphing:** Given two images of human faces, morphed images of the two images are computed using Matlab's Delaunay built-in function and image warping in different timestamps to make a smooth video.
Correspoing points of the faces are manully selected using cpselect function. In order to avoid unfilled pixels in the morphed image, backward image warping is used.

# Requirements:
  - All codes were implemented in Matlab 2015b. Higher versions should work too.
